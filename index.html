          Hello, visitor and welcome to my portfolio! This website serves as an example of my front-end skills and point of contact. This website was made with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript, but I am familiar with various libraries and frameworks, such as React and Bootstrap. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am a full-time student at Foothill College and in the process of transferring to the University of California. My interests include technology, programming, cybersecurity, geometry, history, philosophy, geopolitics, botany and playing the piano. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am interested in a career in software engineering and cybersecurity.
          I am always seeking opportunities to improve my skills in these fields.
          I am open to opportunities, such as internships and open source projects.
          For example, I recently completed an <a href="https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/syllabus_spring_2020" id="codepath">Android Development course offered by Codepath.org.</a>
          Please feel free to <span id="contact">contact me</span> about any opportunities.
