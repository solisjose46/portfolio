    <h3 class="text-gutter">Future Full-Time Endeavors</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">As I approach the culmination of my academic journey in May 2024, I am eagerly preparing to
      transition into the professional realm. Seeking a full-time software engineering role, I am excited to bring my
      diverse skill set, dedication, and passion to a dynamic team. Feel free to reach out to discuss potential
      opportunities and collaborations. </p>

    <h3 class="text-gutter">Background</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">U.S. Army veteran with an associate's degree in computer science from Foothill College.
      Currently in my senior year of a software engineering program at Arizona State University, I possess over a year
      of internship experience in development. Driven by my interest in security, I pursued three security certificates
      through a scholarship program during my undergraduate years, which subsequently led to my involvement in Synack
      Red Team. </p>

    <h3 class="text-gutter">Proficiencies at a Glance</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">In my journey through various professional roles and academic pursuits, I have developed a
      versatile skill set that encompasses:</p>

    <h2 class="text-gutter">Work Experience</h2>

    <h3 class="text-gutter">Softpoint</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">At Softpoint, I quickly engaged in Android development, tasked with modernizing their source
      code by replacing deprecated libraries. This honed my skill in deciphering documentation for updated libraries and
      adopting design patterns like MVVM for structured and maintainable apps. I gained practical experience in JSON
      handling, network request troubleshooting, and other skills, showcasing rapid learning and growth.</p>


    <h3 class="text-gutter">Comtech</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">At Comtech, I joined a three-person team, collaborating on a fullstack .NET application with
      a fellow intern and a full-time developer. My JavaScript proficiency was utilized in UI development, benefiting
      from my previous work on the 'jackal-js' project, leading me to contribute significantly during JavaScript code
      reviews. Alongside frontend work, I gained hands-on experience with C# and MSSQL in backend development. Deepening
      my familiarity with the framework, I identified and resolved redundancy issues by proposing and implementing a
      partial views strategy. This approach streamlined our user interfaces, preserving functionality while reducing
      over a thousand lines of code, ultimately enhancing maintainability.</p>

    <h3 class="text-gutter">Cyberforce Q</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">Motivated by my security interests and a university opportunity, I pursued an SOC analyst
      internship with Cyberforce Q. However, the role offered was a development position, leading me to become a junior
      developer on the team. My primary responsibilities involved SOAR automation and API consumption. While on the job,
      I acquired proficiency in Python, extensively using it for development tasks and HTTP requests.</p>

    <h3 class="text-gutter">Amazon Web Services</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">My AWS internship served as a culmination of my experiences. It allowed me to apply the
      development skills acquired from previous internships and the software engineering practices learned at Arizona
      State University. My role involved crafting debugging tools for the applied science team supporting essential AWS
      Services like Network Access Analyzer and Reachability Assessments. I drove the development process using design
      documents, UML diagrams, and agile methodologies, enhancing products based on customer feedback. I automated
      builds and testing through Gradle and JUnit, while daily code reviews ensured quality. This experience provided
      professional exposure to Java and Python software development.</p>

    <h3 class="text-gutter">Synack Red Team</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">An active participant in Synack Red Team, an exclusive bug bounty platform, I engage in
      part-time work at my convenience, primarily for learning purposes. Following the completion of my GWAPT
      certificate, I received an invitation to join. Leveraging my skills in Android and web application development, I
      identify vulnerabilities and earn compensation. My dual background in development and security proves
      advantageous, allowing me to recognize potential vulnerabilities through my developer's perspective and intimately
      understand application structures as a security researcher.</p>
